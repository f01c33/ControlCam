This repository contains most of the files produces for [this University project](https://eventos.utfpr.edu.br//sicite/sicite2017/author/submission/1342), it is a remote ip camera controller and computer vision feedback loop system.

You can read the whole report [here (Portuguese)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/111XRLYscLlV0MlqGpmJRUhuo6g2CMtaF1wGlQFqNHHw/edit?usp=sharing).
